DevOps Assembly line project
Kubernetes + php website using  groovy files for automation on jenkins
Create container image thatâ€™s has Jenkins installed using dockerfile Or You can use the Jenkins Server on RHEL 8/7

When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.

Create a job chain of job1, job2, job3 and job4 using build pipeline plugin in Jenkins

Job2 ( Seed Job ) : Pull the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.

Further on jobs should be pipeline using written code using Groovy language by the developer

Job1 :

By looking at the code or program file, Jenkins should automatically s tart the respective language interpreter installed image container to deploy code on top of Kubernetes ( eg. If code is of PHP, then Jenkins should start the container that has PHP already installed )

Expose your pod so that testing team could perform the testing on the pod

Make the data to remain persistent using PVC ( If server collects some data like logs, other user information )

Job3 : Test your app if it is working or not.

Job4 : if app is not working , then send email to developer with error messages and redeploy the application after code is being edited by the dev eloper
